# About me

I have graduated with a Bachelors Degree in Information Technology from UVU
I have always been interested in video games, and in modding.
I am interested in learning more about modding, and have looked into it a fair amount. 
I think Morrowind might be a good place to start as I have been playing it a lot and I have used many mods for it.
I hope to be able to learn more and potentially work on making games myself.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on contract projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about C#
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Game mods
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with advice on how to advance my career.
